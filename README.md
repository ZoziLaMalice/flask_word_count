## Flask Word Count Web App

# Project Description

The objective of this project was to become familiar with **postgreSQL** databases, and their interactions with a Web App on the **Flask framework**.</br>

The objective of the application is to count all the words on a website (link provided by the user).</br> 
Then, the application will establish a classification of the most used words thanks to the NLTK libraries, and finally make a graph thanks to the Javascript library D3.js</br>
